# Figma vector rotation plugin
This plugin performs rotation of the selected shape in a 3D space.

# Installation for development

You MUST have node.js version >= 18. It is convenient to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for install\switch node.js versions.

Install the TypeScript globally:
```shell
npm install -g typescript
```

Clone the repo and do `npm i` or `yarn` depending on package manager that you use.

```shell
npm i
```

While development stage use the `watch` script. It would automatically reload the plugin when any changes are made:
```shell
npm start watch
```
